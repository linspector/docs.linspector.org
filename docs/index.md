## Documentation and Guides

The following documentation is available to you:

- <a href="/faq/">The Linspector FAQ's</a>
- <a href="/installation-guide/">Installation Guide</a>
- <a href="/minimal-configuration-guide/">Minimal Configuration Guide</a>

If you want to try to understand how Linspector works you can take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/linspector/linspector/blob/master/examples/minimal.json" class="ext">minimal.json configuration file</a>. It really shows up what is currently possible with Linspector but is not documented. Please ask us if you want to know more.

More documentation will follow ASAP! It is a work in progress.
