<h3>Tutorials and Guides</h3>

<p>The following documentation is available to you:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/documentation/installation-guide/">Installation Guide</a></li>
  <li><a href="/documentation/minimal-configuration-guide/">Minimal Configuration Guide</a></li>
  <li><a href="/documentation/faq/">The Linspector FAQ's</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you wanna try to understand how Linspector works you can take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/linspector/linspector/blob/master/examples/minimal.json" class="ext">minimal.json configuration file</a>. It really shows up what is currently possible with Linspector but is not documented. Please ask us if you want to know more.</p>

<p>More documentation will follow ASAP! It is a work in progress.</p>
